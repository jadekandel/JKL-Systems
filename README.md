# JKL-Systems

I studied L-Stems using "The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants" by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz. I created a Python turtle graphics program that randomly generates tree and tree silhouettes. My goal was to create a balance between order and disorder to depict an artistic and realistic representation of trees. This is an independent project pursued outside of school without a mentor.
