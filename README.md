# JKL-Systems

I studied L-Stems using "The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants" by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz. I created this Python turtle graphics program that randomly generates tree and tree silhouettes. My goal was to create a balance between order and disorder to depict an artistic and realistic representation of 2D tree silhouettes. This is an independent project pursued outside of school without a mentor. 

The program takes about 20 minutes to draw when the window is minimized, and 45 minutes not minimized. I have included a timelapse demonstrating the turtle drawing a tree at 30x speed, along with examples of completed drawings. There are more examples on my website under "Graphics": https://jadekandel.wixsite.com/jadesart/l-system-tree-silhouettes-2020.

I don't have commit history because I just uploaded this project
